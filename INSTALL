Instruction to build fidoconfig
-------------------------------

0. The smapi package is required for the fidoconfig packages

1. Put the fidoconfig package in the directory where the other packages of fido
   husky reside:

   unix, beos, cygwin, djgpp, os/2 emx:
   -------------------
   /usr/src/packages/        -> huskybse/
                             -> huskylib/
                             -> smapi/
                             -> fidoconfig/
			     -> areafix/
                             -> hpt/
                             -> htick/
                             ...some other

   windows, dos, os/2 & etc:
   -------------------------
   d:\husky\                 -> huskylib\
                             -> smapi\
			     -> fidoconf\
			     -> areafix\
                             -> hpt\
                             -> htick\
                             ...some other

2. Determine which makefile you need to use then compile (and install if need)
   fidoconfig using selected makefile, as following examples:
   Example 1 (use common makefile (named 'Makefile'): require huskymak.cfg (see
              huskybse); unixes only):
	$ make
	$ make install
   Example 2 (use platfom-specific makefile):
   linux:
	$ make -f makefile.lnx
	$ make -f makefile.lnx install
   dos (DJGPP GCC):
        d:\husky\fidoconfig>make -f makefile.djg
   windows (MS Visual C/C++):
        d:\husky\fidoconfig>nmake -f makefile.mvc

3. (For UNIXes only) Ensure /usr/local/lib/ is in /etc/ld.so.conf

4. (For UNIXes only) Execute ldconfig as root

5. Write a fido config according to the proposal which is also in this package.
   (UNIXes only: if your are just some normal point, give the shell script
   fidoInst a chance.) Always test the config after changes with the tparser
   tool, which you can place in a directory listed in the PATH enviroment
   variable.

You're ready. Now you can install hpt and other software which uses fidoconfig.
